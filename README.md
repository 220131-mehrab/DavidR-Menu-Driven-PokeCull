# DavidR-Menu-Driven-PokeCull

My history is littered with programming and coding experiences. Some of my fondest comes from the command prompt days with the BASIC language. So, I decided to make a BASH script like I would have back in the 90's with BASIC and incorporating with what I have learned in this class with BASH scripting; an interactive menu-driven sorter of the CSV file attached to this repository.

1--Initial Upload. Just got the interactive menu working with the arrow keys. It has a tiny lag in it, and I could use CUP and CDN commands to make it a tad faster, but I am happy with the results. Now to add my knowledge gained from class.
